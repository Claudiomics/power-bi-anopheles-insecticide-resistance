# power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance

This project showcases my skills in Power BI, which were developed by Peregrine's training programme. Since I'm on a mac, I needed to use a MS Azure VM to run PowerBI on. Here is the link to the .pdf file of my powerpoint presentation:

###Introduction 

This is a presentation of my open-source data project, for which I used Power BI to create a dashboard on mosquito insecticide resistance.

###Project Aim

To guide me through each phase of the data analysis process, I used the OSEMN framework, which stands for Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and Interpret. By following these steps, I framed a definitive set of questions, which guided the information I would include on the dashboard to be able to extract meaningful insights.

###Problem Statement

Malaria and other vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and kill on average 400 thousand people every year.

Currently, the two main methods for vector control are indoor residual house spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets. However, an alarming rate of vector resistance to these insecticides is causing the resurgence of Malaria cases. Climate change and the increase in global travel aids in this spread of resistance.

Developing a new class of insecticides takes 12-15 years and costs over $250 million dollars. Therefore, it is critical to build localised resistance profiles for specific areas and propose tailored plans to tackle the spread of resistance using the current insecticides we have available.
