This project showcases my skills in Power BI, which were developed by Peregrine's training programme. Since I'm on a mac, I needed to use a MS Azure VM to run PowerBI on. Here is the link to the .pdf file of my powerpoint presentation:

### Introduction 

This is a presentation of my open-source data project, for which I used Power BI to create a dashboard on mosquito insecticide resistance.

### Project Aim

To guide me through each phase of the data analysis process, I used the OSEMN framework, which stands for Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and Interpret. By following these steps, I framed a definitive set of questions, which guided the information I would include on the dashboard to be able to extract meaningful insights.

### Problem Statement

Malaria and other vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and kill on average 400 thousand people every year.

Currently, the two main methods for vector control are indoor residual house spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets. However, an alarming rate of vector resistance to these insecticides is causing the resurgence of Malaria cases. Climate change and the increase in global travel aids in this spread of resistance.

Developing a new class of insecticides takes 12-15 years and costs over $250 million dollars. Therefore, it is critical to build localised resistance profiles for specific areas and propose tailored plans to tackle the spread of resistance using the current insecticides we have available.

### Dashboard

On the left-hand side, is a filled map showing an overview of the distribution of resistance across the globe. As this data set contains local information as well as country name, we can drill down in this hierarchy to display resistance by region, which is important when designing localized plans to tackle spread. You can also use the legend to filter by resistance status: confirmed, possible and susceptible meaning the mosquitos are still sensitive to the insecticide. Underneath is a slider to display how resistance changes over time. 

<img width="1037" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 07 32 05" src="https://github.com/Claudiomics/power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance/assets/149532217/98e10f86-66f0-40be-a2b5-e94e6f5d5289">

Set to 2007, it's clear resistance has spread rapidly, highlighting the urgent need for alternative vector control. The graph underneath shows the total number of registered cases over time to emphasize this point.

<img width="961" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 07 41 32" src="https://github.com/Claudiomics/power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance/assets/149532217/e8f83e41-29af-4535-97c8-3160c312badc">

<img width="404" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 07 41 53" src="https://github.com/Claudiomics/power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance/assets/149532217/156aafbe-c688-45e0-a501-375ff73b9258">

On the right hand side is a multi-row card displaying the top 5 mosquito species from whatever filters are on the page.

For example, if you select confirmed resistance on the map, you can see that 58% of _Anopholese_ gambiae mosquitos make up that resistance, followed by _Anopheles_ arabiensis at 18%. 
If you select by location like the country Afghanistan, the most resistant species is _Anopheles_ stephensi. You can see how this also changes the mechanisms of resistance graphs.

<img width="961" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 07 41 18" src="https://github.com/Claudiomics/power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance/assets/149532217/35e842c8-ebaa-4a40-b069-9a5fafdf797c">

The pie chart displays the percentage of insecticides that mosquitos are resistant to, by class and type. The class of insecticides which most mosquitos are resistant to is pyrethroids. This is a major problem since they are the only insecticide deemed safe enough for use in treated nets, since they need to be non-toxic enough for babies to put in their mouths. 

<img width="524" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-12 at 07 44 41" src="https://github.com/Claudiomics/power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance/assets/149532217/68dcb456-76fc-45c9-92ed-addb15ce2fcb">

And finally, mechanisms of resistance. Insecticides work by targeting the nervous system of mosquitos, by binding to specific sites and causing paralysis. Mutations in these target sites prevent insecticides from binding, leading to resistance. Since they survive, these mutated genes are passed to the next generation. If we wind back to 2003, there was only the kdr mutation leading to pyrethroid and organochlorine resistance. Since then, mutations in the ace1R gene have become more prevalent. 

The second mechanism of resistance is how quickly insecticides are metabolized. The upregulation of cytochrome P450, esterases and GSTs all lead to resistance to different classes of insecticides as detailed in the ‘mechanism mapping’ table.
Selecting by species shows the difference in mechanism type and provides an insight into which insecticides would be most effective on that species by area.

### Conclusion and Future Improvements

To conclude, this dashboard can be used to design localized resistance profiles and unique plans of action to tackle the spread of resistance. While new insecticides are being developed, we need to make what we currently have as effective as possible to limit the spread of resistance and re-emergence of Malaria, especially in Africa where resistance has spread rapidly.

One questions, I was unfortunately unable to answer was predicting which geographic areas are likely to see an increase in resistance. In future projects, I would like to incorporate a regression analysis of the data using python.

I would have also liked to have a second section to the dashboard elaborating on the molecular mechanisms and be able to propose combinations such as two insecticides, or insecticides paired with a synergist to help tackle this global problem.
