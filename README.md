# power-bi-anopheles-insecticide-resistance

This project showcases my skills in Power BI, which were developed by Peregrine's training programme. Since I'm on a mac, I needed to use a MS Azure VM to run PowerBI on. Here is the link to the .pdf file of my powerpoint presentation:

### Introduction 

This is a presentation of my open-source data project, for which I used Power BI to create a dashboard on mosquito insecticide resistance.

### Project Aim

To guide me through each phase of the data analysis process, I used the OSEMN framework, which stands for Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and Interpret. By following these steps, I framed a definitive set of questions, which guided the information I would include on the dashboard to be able to extract meaningful insights.

### Problem Statement

Malaria and other vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and kill on average 400 thousand people every year.

Currently, the two main methods for vector control are indoor residual house spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets. However, an alarming rate of vector resistance to these insecticides is causing the resurgence of Malaria cases. Climate change and the increase in global travel aids in this spread of resistance.

Developing a new class of insecticides takes 12-15 years and costs over $250 million dollars. Therefore, it is critical to build localised resistance profiles for specific areas and propose tailored plans to tackle the spread of resistance using the current insecticides we have available.

### Dashboard

On the left-hand side, is a filled map showing an overview of the distribution of resistance across the globe. As this data set contains local information as well as country name, we can drill down in this hierarchy to display resistance by region, which is important when designing localized plans to tackle spread. You can also use the legend to filter by resistance status: confirmed, possible and susceptible meaning the mosquitos are still sensitive to the insecticide. Underneath is a slider to display how resistance changes over time.

Set to 2007, it's clear resistance has spread rapidly, highlighting the urgent need for alternative vector control. The graph underneath shows the total number of registered cases over time to emphasize this point.

On the right hand side is a multi-row card displaying the top 5 mosquito species from whatever filters are on the page.

For example, if you select confirmed resistance on the map, you can see that 58% of _Anopholese_ gambiae mosquitos make up that resistance, followed by _Anopheles_ arabiensis at 18%. 
If you select by location like the country Afghanistan, the most resistant species is _Anopheles_ stephensi. You can see how this also changes the mechanisms of resistance graphs.
